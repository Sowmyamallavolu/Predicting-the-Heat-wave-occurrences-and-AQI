# Overview
# Identifying the Issues: Problems We Aim to Address
**HEAT WAVE**

A heat wave is a prolonged period of abnormally high temperatures.
Heatwaves have become more frequent and intense in many parts of the world leading to adverse health effects.
Predicting the occurrence of Heat waves can make a significant contribution to protecting public health and preventing infrastructure damage.
It can also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by predicting the demand for electricity.

**AQI**

AQI is a measure used to report the air quality in a specific area.
Predicting AQI can help people take precautions to protect their health from harmful air pollutants. 
It can also help government agencies in regulating emissions from sources of pollutions.
It can promote more sustainable urban planning practices.

# Idea/ Solution 
**Heat waves**

Random forest regression is an used for predicting the average temperature.
Features and hyperparameters are carefully chosen to ensure that the model is accurate and generalizable to new data. 
MAPE is used to evaluate the performance of the model

**AQI**

ARIMA stands for the Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average.
It is a commonly used technique for forecasting future values of a time series variable. 
The sub-indices for the forecasted pollutant values are calculated and disseminated. 
The Individual pollutant-wise sub-index will provide air quality status for that pollutant.
Aggregation of these sub-indices gives the AQI value.
